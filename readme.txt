A font rasterizer.

Is a GUI tool allowing you to rasterize TrueType fonts installed to your system.

TGA, BMP, binary, and text outputs are currently supported.

Usage:
- When you made changes to the typeface, press the Update button, so the changes are applied.
- When you want to export the rasterized font, press Save...

I have troubles creating releases (browser issue), so I put the compiled binaries into the repository itself (see release.zip).
